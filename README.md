# Rate My Courses
*Rate My Courses* is a spinoff of the popular Rate My Professors but aims to provide students with a platform for sharing their opinions about classes instead of people–how much homework will I get every week? How is the course structured? What content do we actually learn? How do we learn that content? All of these questions can be answered through the collective feedback of students who have taken the course and Rate My Courses provides a place to collect and access that information.
FCQs are offered by the school but have no way for students to freely express opinions, warnings, or advice for other students to see. Rate My Courses has users rate courses by metrics but also has a place for users to write comments without restriction. Reviews are then self-moderated by other users with a rating system that ensures malicious or hateful comments are quickly hidden from the view of others. The user can additionally sort through reviews on the course page (filter reviews by most votes, year the review was written for, or by ascending/descending overall rating) to easily find the reviews that are most relevant to them. All in all, Rate My Courses is a platform for students, by students, and aims to deliver important information to guide students in taking the courses that will resonate with them most.
